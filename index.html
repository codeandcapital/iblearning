      Walk me through the 3 financial statements

        “The 3 major financial statements are the Income Statement, Balance Sheet and Cash
        Flow Statement.
        The Income Statement gives the company’s revenue and expenses, and goes down to
        Net Income, the final line on the statement.
        The Balance Sheet shows the company’s Assets – its resources – such as Cash, Inventory
        and PP&E, as well as its Liabilities – such as Debt and Accounts Payable – and
        Shareholders’ Equity. Assets must equal Liabilities plus Shareholders’ Equity.
        The Cash Flow Statement begins with Net Income, adjusts for non-cash expenses and
        working capital changes, and then lists cash flow from investing and financing activities;
        at the end, you see the company’s net change in cash.”</p>
